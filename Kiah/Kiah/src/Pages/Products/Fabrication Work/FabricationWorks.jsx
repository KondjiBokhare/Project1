        <p>All kind of Metal Works By definition Metal Fabrication Work is the creation of any metal structure by bending, cutting, welding and assembling processes. This is an extra added service that requires building of machineries, movable and / or immovable machine parts or structures from various raw materials such as pipes, tubes, fasteners, circles, etc. as per the classifications and dimensions provided by the project and / or product engineer.</p>                
        <p>This value added service is beneficial to the contractor as they do not have to allocate or employ multiple vendors or sources for each fabrication work. At, KIAH METALLURGICAL INDIAN EXPORTERS, we understand the importance of work allocation and thus our fabrication work is on point from raw material selection to precise measurements to the final production of the physical goods. Our Fabrication units have employed Original Equipment Manufacturers, Value - Added Resellers and Contractors who have resources to procure various raw materials and process them by cutting, bending, welding and assembling them. Which is later machined and polished to cover up the raw metal look which is definitely not eye pleasing.</p>
        <p>We have investments made in Specialties, which is used for Fabrication Work as well as per the customer requirement. Such Specialties include Powder Metallurgy, Powder Coating, Casting and Rust preventive Painting.</p>
